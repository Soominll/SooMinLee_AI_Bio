This has led to more accurate variant identification and a reduction in SV calls by up to 78%. I also work on actionable findings in cancer genomics, integrating `The Clinical Knowledgebase (CKB)` into our somatic pipeline to improve data accessibility for actionable drugs, on-label drug recommendations, and clinical trial matching. Additionally, I lead AI-driven projects developing `deep learning-based mutation callers` to enhance mutation detection accuracy and efficiency.","highlights":["Genomics","Whole genome sequencing","Mutation detection","Deep learning","Actionable findings"]}],"volunteer":[],"education":[{"institution":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)","location":"Daejoen, South Korea","url":"https://www.kaist.ac.kr/","area":"Bio & Brain Engineering","studyType":"M.S.","startDate":"2020-09-01","endDate":"2022-08-01","score":"10","courses":["Graph Machine Learning and Mining","Genome Bioinformatics","Data Mining"]},{"institution":"Handong Global University (HGU)","location":"Pohang, South Korea","url":"","area":"Double major in Computer Science & Life Science","studyType":"B.S. - Summa cum laude, Early graduation","startDate":"2017-03-01","endDate":"2020-06-01","score":"20","courses":["Applied Genomics","Biodata Analysis","Molecular Biology","Machine Learning"]},{"institution":"Allendale Columbia School","location":"Rochester, NY, U.S.A.","url":"","area":"","studyType":"High school","startDate":"2013-01-01","endDate":"2016-06-01","score":"10","courses":["Studied abroad for high school in the United States"]}],"awards":[{"title":"Top honor in Life Science from Handong Global University (1%)","date":"2020","awarder":"","url":"","summary":""},{"title":"Academic Excellence Scholarship","date":"2018,2019,2020","awarder":"","url":"","summary":""},{"title":"Software Mileage Scholarship","date":"2020","awarder":"","url":"","summary":""},{"title":"Excellence prize at Software Festival held by Handong University;","date":"2019","awarder":"","url":"","summary":"Convergence Research Contest & SW Problem-Solving Idea Contest"}],"certificates":[{"name":"Big Data Analyst","date":"","issuer":"Ministry of Science and ICT / Statistics Korea","url":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-location-dot"}],"publications":[{"name":"Deep learning untangles the resistance mechanism of p53 reactivator in lung cancer cells","publisher":"Cell Iscience","releaseDate":"2023","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38034356/","summary":"Proposed a novel combinatorial target and computational method to overcome drug resistance to p53 activator in lung cancer using GAN and GNN."}],"skills":[{"name":"Deep learning","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Generative Adversarial Network","Graph Neural Network","Deep CNN model"]},{"name":"Programming languages","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Python","R","Java","C","C++"]},{"name":"Laboratory skills","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Cell culture","DNA/RNA extraction and purification","Recombinant DNA technology","PCR","qRT-PCR","Western blotting","gel electrophoresis","transfection","viral transduction"]}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Full professional proficiency","icon":""},{"language":"Korean","fluency":"Native fluency","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Personalized Medicine","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag"},{"name":"Machine Learning","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag"},{"name":"Multi-omics","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag"},{"name":"Drug Discovery","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag"},{"name":"Cancer","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag"}],"Research Experience":[{"name":"Deep learning untangles the resistance mechanism of p53 reactivator in lung cancer cells","summary":"Master Thesis & Journal publication & KOR/US patent","highlights":["Problem: Though TP53 mutations in lung cancer make p53 activator treatments essential, drug resistance limits their effectiveness.","Contributions: Developed a novel computational approach using Generative adversarial networks and Graph neural networks to identify drug resistance mechanisms and therapeutic targets.
