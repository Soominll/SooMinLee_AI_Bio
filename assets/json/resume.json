My work also encompasses actionable findings in cancer genomics, where I contribute to annotating clinical relevance for various genomic alterations such as CNVs, SVs, SNVs, and INDELs, facilitating the mapping of disease terms and refining clinical trial data. Additionally, I am leading AI-driven projects to develop deep learning-based mutation callers.","highlights":["Genomics"]}],"volunteer":[],"education":[{"institution":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)","location":"Daejoen, South Korea","url":"https://www.kaist.ac.kr/","area":"Bio & Brain Engineering","studyType":"M.S.","startDate":"2020-09-01","endDate":"2022-09-01","score":"10","courses":["Graph Machine Learning and Mining","Genome Bioinformatics","Data Mining"]},{"institution":"Handong Global University (HGU)","location":"Pohang, South Korea","url":"https://www.uzh.ch/","area":"Double major in Computer Science & Life Science","studyType":"B.S. - Summa cum laude, Early graduation","startDate":"2017-03-01","endDate":"2020-06-01","score":"20","courses":[""]}{"institution":"Allendale Columbia School","location":"Rochester, NY, U.S.A.","url":"","area":"","studyType":"Studied abroad for high school in the United States","startDate":"","endDate":"2016-06-01","score":"10","courses":[""]}],"awards":[{"title":"Top honor in Life science from Handong Global University (1%)","date":"2020","awarder":"","url":"","summary":"The Nobel Prizes are five separate prizes that, according to Alfred Nobel's will of 1895, are awarded to 'those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.'"},{"title":"Academic Excellence Scholarship for Seniors","date":"2018,2019,2020","awarder":"","url":"","summary":""}],"certificates":[],"publications":[{"name":"Deep learning untangles the resistance mechanism of p53 reactivator in lung cancer cells","publisher":"Cell Iscience","releaseDate":"2023","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38034356/","summary":"Proposed a novel combinatorial target and computational method to overcome drug resistance to p53 activator in lung cancer using GAN and GNN."}],"skills":[{"name":"Deep learning","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Generative Adversarial Network","Graph Neural Network","Deep CNN model",]}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"Korean","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"AI based Drug Discovery","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Generative AI","Drug Discovery","Drug resistance","Graph Neural Network",]}],"references":[{"name":"Professor John Doe","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","reference":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
