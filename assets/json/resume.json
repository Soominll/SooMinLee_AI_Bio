This has led to more accurate variant identification and a reduction in SV calls by up to 78%. I also work on actionable findings in cancer genomics, integrating `The Clinical Knowledgebase (CKB)` into our somatic pipeline to improve data accessibility for actionable drugs, on-label drug recommendations, and clinical trial matching. Additionally, I lead AI-driven projects developing `deep learning-based mutation callers` to enhance mutation detection accuracy and efficiency.",
