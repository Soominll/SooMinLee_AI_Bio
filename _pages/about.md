I am a Computational Genomics Specialist with a strong foundation in bioinformatics and machine learning, earned through an M.S. in Bio and Brain Engineering from KAIST and a B.S. in Computer Science and Life Science from Handong Global University. Currently, I serve as part of the Pipeline Development team at Inocras Korea, where I focus on developing and refining advanced computational pipelines for both somatic and germline genomic analysis.

In my current role, I work extensively on structural variant (SV) calling, involving comparison and implementation of various SV callers, enhancing SV refinement tools, and improving sensitivity in detecting complex genomic alterations. My work also encompasses actionable findings in cancer genomics, where I contribute to annotating clinical relevance for various genomic alterations such as CNVs, SNVs, and INDELs, facilitating the mapping of disease terms and refining clinical trial data. Additionally, I am leading AI-driven projects to develop deep learning-based mutation callers, designing input features that push the boundaries of precision medicine.

My research background includes the development of novel computational methods to combat drug resistance in cancer using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), which culminated in a patent for a combinatorial target and computational approach. My hands-on laboratory experience, combined with technical proficiency in Python, R, Java, and C++, equips me to tackle complex challenges in genomics and contribute to groundbreaking advancements in human health.

Fluent in both Korean and English, I excel in collaborative, interdisciplinary environments. My academic achievements include top honors in Life Science and multiple academic excellence scholarships, reflecting my commitment to excellence in research. My primary interests lie in precision medicine, cancer genomics, and drug discovery, where I strive to make significant contributions through innovative research and technology development.
