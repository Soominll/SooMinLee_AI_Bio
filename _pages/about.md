As a dedicated Computational Genomics Specialist, I bring a solid foundation in bioinformatics and machine learning, underpinned by an M.S. in Bio and Brain Engineering from KAIST and a B.S. in Computer Science and Life Science from Handong Global University. Currently, I am advancing the field of genomics as part of the Pipeline Development team at Inocras Korea, where I focus on developing cutting-edge somatic and germline analysis pipelines. My work involves enhancing structural variant (SV) calling tools and developing AI-driven mutation callers to push the boundaries of precision medicine.

My research has led to the development of novel computational methods to combat drug resistance in cancer, particularly through the use of GANs and GNNs. My passion for genomics is matched by a strong technical skill set, including proficiency in Python, R, Java, and C++, and hands-on laboratory experience. This blend of computational expertise and practical research experience allows me to contribute meaningfully to projects that bridge the gap between AI and genomics.

In addition to my technical skills, I am fluent in both Korean and English, which enables me to collaborate effectively in global research environments. My academic journey has been recognized with numerous awards, including top honors in Life Science and multiple academic excellence scholarships. I am driven by a deep interest in precision medicine, cancer genomics, and drug discovery, and I am committed to making significant contributions to the advancement of human health through innovative research and technology development.
