I am a <b>Computational Genomics Specialist</b> with a strong foundation in `bioinformatics` and `Deep Learning`, earned through an M.S. in Bio and Brain Engineering from KAIST and a B.S. in Computer Science and Life Science from Handong Global University. 
Currently, I serve as part of the Pipeline Development team at <a href='https://inocras.com/' target="_blank">Inocras</a>, where I focus on developing and refining advanced computational pipelines for both somatic and germline genomic analysis.

My research background includes the development of computational methods to combat drug resistance in cancer using `generative adversarial networks (GANs)` and `graph neural networks (GNNs)` ([link to paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38034356/)). My hands-on laboratory experience, combined with technical proficiency in Python, R, Java, and C++, equips me to tackle complex challenges in genomics and contribute to advancements in human health.

My academic achievements include top honors in Life Science and multiple academic excellence scholarships, reflecting my commitment to excellence in research.
Fluent in both Korean and English, I excel in collaborative, interdisciplinary environments. 
My primary interests lie in precision medicine, cancer genomics, and drug discovery, where I strive to make significant contributions through innovative research and technology development.
